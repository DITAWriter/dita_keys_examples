    <shortdesc>How to apply power to the <ph keyref="computer_name"/> <ph keyref="peripheral_name"/>.</shortdesc>
    <refbody><refsyn>
        <note>The Power switch is recessed into the front of the <ph keyref="peripheral_name"/> to prevent
            accidental loss of power. Activate the switch with the eraser-end of a pencil or small
            tool of similar size.</note>
        <p>Apply power to the <ph keyref="peripheral_name"/>. Notice that when power is off, the end surface of
            the switch is white and when power is on, it changes to orange.</p>
