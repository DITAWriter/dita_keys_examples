    <shortdesc>Additional information, including block diagram, interface connections, and the
        suggested placement for the expansion interface.</shortdesc>

            <p>Possibly, you will not need all of the expansion modules that are available but, we
                have supplied you with Hoods for cable connectors for a complete expansion system.
                Use the Hoods as illustrated to prevent accidental mismatch between the edge
                connectors on the PCB and the cable connectors.</p>
            <p>In the event that you lose a Door or Hood and want to replace it, we have given you a
                Parts List. You may refer to the Parts List and exploded diagrams to determine its
                Part Number. You can order replacement parts through your local <ph conkeyref="product_info/company_name"/>
                store.</p>
            <p>You must have a LEVEL II BASIC <ph conkeyref="product_info/computer_name"/> Microcomputer to utilize the <ph conkeyref="product_info/computer_name"/> Expansion
                Interface, the Line Printer and the Mini-Disk modules. If you have a LEVEL I BASIC
                machine, it must be modified to accept LEVEL II programs. The Screen Printer is the
                only expansion module that may be connected directly to the <ph conkeyref="product_info/computer_name"/> Microcomputer and
                that will operate with LEVEL I machines.</p>
            <p>We are continually improving and updating our <ph conkeyref="product_info/computer_name"/> Microcomputer System. You will
                be kept informed through our Newsletters (you are on the mailing list), addenda and
                revisions to the Manual.</p>
