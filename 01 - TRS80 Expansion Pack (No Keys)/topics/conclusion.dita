        suggested placement for the expansion interface.</shortdesc>

            <p>Possibly, you will not need all of the expansion modules that are available but, we
                have supplied you with Hoods for cable connectors for a complete expansion system.
                Use the Hoods as illustrated to prevent accidental mismatch between the edge
                connectors on the PCB and the cable connectors.</p>
            <p>In the event that you lose a Door or Hood and want to replace it, we have given you a
                Parts List. You may refer to the Parts List and exploded diagrams to determine its
                Part Number. You can order replacement parts through your local Radio Shack
                store.</p>
            <p>You must have a LEVEL II BASIC TRS-80 Microcomputer to utilize the TRS-80 Expansion
                Interface, the Line Printer and the Mini-Disk modules. If you have a LEVEL I BASIC
                machine, it must be modified to accept LEVEL II programs. The Screen Printer is the
                only expansion module that may be connected directly to the TRS-80 Microcomputer and
                that will operate with LEVEL I machines.</p>
            <p>We are continually improving and updating our TRS-80 Microcomputer System. You will
                be kept informed through our Newsletters (you are on the mailing list), addenda and
                revisions to the Manual.</p>
