    <title>Connecting the Cassette Recorder Cable</title>
    <shortdesc>Describes the process for connecting the data cassette recorder cable to the TRS-80
        Expansion Interface.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context><p>The interconnect cable for an expansion module is provided with that unit. See
                Figure 4 for Hood Assembly and Installation.</p><note>A Dummy Plug is provided with
                your Cassette Recorder. Plug it in to the MIC jack. This Plug disconnects the
                built-in microphone so it won't pick up sounds while you are loading
                tapes.</note><note>Your Cassette Recorders may be powered by batteries or from a 120
                VAC source. Thus, AC power cords are optional.</note>
